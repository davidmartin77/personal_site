	<p> My professional goals are straightforward. I want to learn coding and make a career change. I'm hoping coding has some of the same elements that I loved about journalism: learning, writing and creativity. As someone who has never coded before, this decision is comes with a good deal of anxiety and uncertainty. After all, I am absolute beginner and not even a "digital native." I look forward to the day when I know enough to make a contribution somewhere.
