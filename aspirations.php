		<p> <em> Aspirations </em>
		My professional goals are straightforward. I want to learn coding and make a career change. I'm hoping coding has some of the same elements that I loved about journalism: <em> learning, writing and creativity. </em> As someone who has never coded before, this decision is comes with a good deal of anxiety and uncertainty. After all, I am absolute beginner and not even a "digital native." I look forward to the day when I know enough to make a contribution somewhere. </p>
