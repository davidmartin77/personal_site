<h1> About Me </h1>

</div>

<div class = "AboutMe__Text">

<p>I was born in Washington, D.C., and grew up in Boston in the 1960s, the second of four children. This was the dark ages. Kids rode their bikes without helmets, in cars without seatbelts and spent countless hours unsupervised. I took the subway in Boston alone or with friends when I was seven. The time on my own and with nieghborhood kids helped foster my imagination and my ability to navigate the world. It also allowed plenty of time to get into brawls with my brother, who was three years older. They usually didn't end well. </p>

<p>After college, I started working at a small newspaper on Cape Cod as a "cub reporter." The Falmouth Enterprise came out twice a week and printed everything from school lunch menus to noise complaints to planning board meetings. If the New York Times' motto is "All the News That's Fit to Print," The Enterprise's motto could have been "All the News That's Fit to Print - And Then Some." My first year I earned so little money I qualified for a block of cheese from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Still, I liked being a reporter for a newspaper. The job combined learning, writing and creativity.</p>

<p>Journalism took me to larger newspapers and then to CNN, where I worked for almost twenty years. My last job in journalism was as a senior investigative producer for America Tonight, a national newsmagazine show on Al Jazeera America. It was a wonderful job, with a mission of giving voiceless to the voiceless. We uncovered injustices that other media were simply not reporting. The network closed in April. Since then, I've been a freelance writer.</p>

<p>On the home front, I'm married with three kids, two boys and a girl. The boys just started college. My daughter, Olive, is a high school senior. My wife, Ginny, is from Nebraska, and we moved here nine years ago. Although I'm not from here, I truly love Lincoln and "The Good Life." </p>
